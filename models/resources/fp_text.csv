1;Exocanthion R;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
2;Exocanthion L;The point at the outer commissure of the eye where the outer margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. If the precise spot cannot be found then the location is in the intersection of imaginary lines obtained by prolonging the eyelid margins. The point is bilateral.
3;Endocanthion R;The point at the inner commissure of the eye where the inner margin of the upper eyelid meets the lower eyelid. It is the most medial point at the lacrimal caruncle. In case a skin fold is present (epicanthus, plica mongolica, plica marginalis fetis) and the point is not visible, by Kolar and Salterâ€™s recommendations (1997) the landmark is defined as the point where the fold crosses the lower eyelid. In this case the points are not homologous. The point is bilateral.
